    - Gradle

        - Can be used for Java and non-Java projects
        - Uses Groovy-based DSL for configuration, which has a steep learning curve
        - Less mature than Ant and Maven
        - Used in 19% of Java projects



- Maven Components

    - Maven SCM

        Works with source control systems to perform actions like checking out code
          or creating a branch or tag.


    - Maven Wagon

        Downloads project dependencies such as JAR files from different locations such
          as FTPs, file systems, and web sites.


    - Maven Doxia

        Content generation framework that can be used to generate static and dynamic
          content such as PDF files and web pages.  Generates project documentation
